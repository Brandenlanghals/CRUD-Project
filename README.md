# CS340 CRUD Project

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? What were the advantages of working with the CRUD Python module, and how could it be used in the future?

- Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves following good coding practices. This includes using clear and consistent naming conventions, adding comments to explain the code, breaking down the code into modular components, and properly documenting the code. 

- The CRUD Python module provided advantages by separating the database interaction logic from other parts of the project. This made it easier to understand, modify, and reuse the code. In the future, the CRUD Python module can be used in other projects to perform common database operations, saving time and effort in implementing database functionality.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet client requests?

- As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves analyzing the problem, understanding requirements, designing a solution, implementing it, and testing it. In this project, the approach involved understanding the database and dashboard requirements, designing the user interface, implementing the necessary functionality, and testing the dashboard's performance. 

- Compared to previous assignments, this project focused more on real-world application and client requirements. Techniques used included effective communication with the client to understand their needs, designing a user-friendly interface, and delivering a functional solution.
In the future, to create databases that meet client requests, techniques would include thorough requirement gathering, designing an appropriate data model, implementing robust security measures, optimizing database performance, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this project help a company like Grazioso Salvare to do their work better?

- Computer scientists develop solutions using computational tools and techniques. They create software applications, design databases, and solve complex problems using technology. 

- In this project, creating a Python dashboard with interactive features and connecting it to a MongoDB database allows Grazioso Salvare to visualize and interact with their Austin Animal Center (AAC) Outcomes dataset more effectively. This helps them make informed decisions and gain insights from their data, ultimately improving their operations and decision-making processes. This recipe can be applied to nearly any company or project that utilizes data.
